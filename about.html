                                        I'm an innovative thinker and problem solver with several years of experience
                                        in a variety of roles including financial analysis, technical and customer support, leadership,
                                        project management, and most recently both client account management and full stack 
                                        web development.

                                        I posses an excellent and distinguishable work ethic, allowing me to consistently 
                                        deliver exceptional results.  I am a great team player with a keen ability to

                                        process, and ultimately finding a viable solution.  Furthermore, I am able to do this
                                        while considering team dynamics, company and project objectives, as well as client
                                        expectations.

                                        I'm currently a Transactions Cost Analysis Account Manager at Bloomberg LP, where
                                        I am leveraging technical and client facing skills from previous roles.  My main
                                        responsibility is to assist clients in optimizing their usage of the platform, while
                                        creating and identifying opportunities for additional revenue.  In addition to this,
                                        I also collaborate with product managers and engineers to discuss product feedback,
                                        and formulate ideas on how to improve the product. Prior to this, I held several 
                                        technical, analytical and client support roles
                                        at Bloomberg LP.  These include: Integrations Project Manager for the TCA product,
                                        Escalated Support Specialist for the TCA product, and Support Specialist for the
                                        Equity Analytics platform.

                                        I'm always looking for ways to grow professionally and personally, which led me to

                                        coding bootcamp.  I hope to combine my newly acquired software development skills
                                        with my previous career experiences in order to become an innovative software
